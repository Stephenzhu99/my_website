The `gapminder` dataset from R `gapminder` package has data on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for 142 countries from 1952 to 2007. The aim of the project today is to have a glance at how the average life expectancy of across 5 continents changed over the past 55 years.

First, load the packages needed.

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(gapminder)  # gapminder dataset
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)
```

Then we have a look at the completness and first 20 rows of the data.
```{r}
skim(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) 

```

We begin the analysis by producing two graphs on how life expectancy has changed over the years for the `country` and the `continent` I come from.

```{r}
# filter the gapminder dataset for specific country and continent, then assigning separately to two datasets
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == 'New Zealand')

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Oceania")
```

A plot of life expectancy over time for the single country I come from is created by map `year` on the x-axis, and `lifeExp` on the y-axis.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country}
# create the plot
plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year,y = lifeExp))+
  # add the data points
  geom_point() +
  # generate a line of best fit
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  NULL

 plot1
```

Next I want to add a title, using the `labs()` function.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country_with_label}
# add an informative title to plot1
 plot1<- plot1 +
   labs(title = "New Zealand Change in Life Expectancy 1952-2007",
       x = " ",
       y = " ") +
   NULL

 plot1
```

Similarly, a plot for all countries in the *continent* I come from is produced, where the *country* variable is mapped on both the colour and group aesthetic to show the countries by different colour but also group them together when computing line of best fit.

```{r lifeExp_one_continent}
# create the plot
 ggplot(continent_data, mapping = aes(x = year , y =  lifeExp, colour= country, group =country))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   labs(title = "Oceania Change in Life Expectancy 1952-2007")
   NULL
```

Finally, using the original `gapminder` data, I produced a life expectancy over time graph, faceted by continent. I removed all legends by adding the `theme(legend.position="none")` at the end of our ggplot.

```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
# create the plot
 ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year, y =  lifeExp, color= continent))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   facet_wrap(~continent) +
   theme(legend.position="none") + # remove all legends
   labs(title = "World Change in Life Expectancy 1952-2007 Faceted by Continents") +
   NULL
```

After plotting the graphs, we can have a careful look at them. Several observations can be made, especially on the differences among continents:

1.  **Geneal Trend:** First and most general observation is that the life expectancy in all continents have been increasing in the past years since 1952, likely because of development in technology that improved everyone's life quality. Besides, in all continents apart from Oceania, which has too small a sample size of only two countries, the rate of increase in life expectancy is slowing down. This signifies to a degree a halt of significant development in life sciences and related technologies.

2.  **By Continent:** Going down to the continent level, Oceania has the highest life expectancy, followed closely by America and Europe, whereas Asia and Africa lie further behind. Such difference represents to a degree the difference in wealth level and average living standards among continents. Furthermore, interesting patterns can be observed in distribution of life expectancy of each country within each continent. Oceania has only two countries and their life expectancy are rather similar. In Europe, most countries have rather long and similar life expectancies, apart from one outlier which was extraordinarily low from 1950 to 1990 but caught up since then. This suggests that most countries in Europe are quite well developed, perhaps apart one which only caught up after 1990. On the other hand, Africa, America and Asia have much wider distribution in life expectancy by country, showing that the level of wealthiness and development in these continents are more differentiated.
