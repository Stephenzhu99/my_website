I am **Stephen Zhu**, currently a member of the LBS MAM2022 cohort and an engineering undergradaute from UCL. Having completed just recently my summer internship at Ekimetrics, a boutique consulting firm specialising in **data science consulting**, I am actively looking for a full-time role in strategic consulting starting 2023. Throughout my undergraduate study to obtain a balchelor's degree in mechanical engineering at University College London (UCL), I selected numerous machine learning related modules, which inspired my interest in data analytics. In this way, I am excited by the chance to study a Master in Analytics and Management degree at London Business School (LBS) to both deepen my technical understanding of data analytics and more importantly its applications in aspects of business strategy and management.

I have rather diversified professional experiences working in various sectors, including consulting, finance, and consumer good. Throughout the times as intern analyst/consultant, I developed the skills to clean data and extract insights from them, then utilising them in aiding the strategic decision making and communicating them in a clear and comprehensive way. Besides the business experiences, I also participated in numerous extracurricular activities or societies, such as debating and table tennis. Namely, I am also the founder and vice president of the UCL Business Negotiation Society, and led the team to obtain a top 4 place in the 2019 UK Business Negotiation Competition.

Outside the formal professional and leadership experiences, I hope to also include some fun facts about myself. I am a travel enthusiast as I enjoy exploring the different natural and cultural landscapes around the world. In my spare time, table tennis, Chess and Chinese Chess are some of my recent hobbies in terms of sports and board games. Also, I am a pet fan and I own three cute kittens, two ragdoll and one British long hair. Down below is a photo of my oldest kiteen Colly, a blue bi-color ragdoll.
